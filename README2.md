# AIM 
The project is based on the article “Metabolic Roles of uncultivated Bacterioplankton Lineages in the Northern Gulf of Mexico ‘ Dead Zone’” published on September 12th, 2017. It focuses on the ‘dead zones’ which are essentially the regions where there is a reduced eukaryotic microbiota: shrimp, fish, etc. Here, we focus on the Gulf of Mexico to extract samples that can be differentiated based on the DO ( dissolved O2 concentration). 
The goal of the project is to carry out the annotation of genomes to identify metabolic pathways in Carbon, Nitrogen, and Sulfur cycles and energy production in the microbial communities under study.
